# Sorting Visualizer 
This is a sorting visualizer made in c++ using sfml, so far it only does insertion and bubble sort might do other sorting algorithms in the future.

## How to use it 
Pressing 1 on the keyboard does bubble sort, pressing 2 does insertion sort and if you press 0 it resets and generates new
unsorted rectangle.
